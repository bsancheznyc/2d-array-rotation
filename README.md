# 2d Array Rotation

  Python3 generates & rotates the grid, angular shows the magic!.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.6 & up
- Virtual Environment (pipenv)
- Angular 4 & up
 

#### My todo list for README.md
- add setup system and pip installations
- explain approach of grid generation
- explain my solution to rotations of grid
- show that n rotations can be optimized with this formula:
          (n rotations / total_cells_in_frame) * total_cells_in_frame
